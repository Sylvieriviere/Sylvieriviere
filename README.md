- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sylvieriviere
  I'm a final-year Mechanical Engineering student transitioning into the world of Data Science. 
  With a strong passion for coding and a goal to become proficient in Machine Learning, I'm currently honing my skills through various projects on freeCodeCamp and other learning platforms like edX.
  I'm eager to learn, open to new opportunities, and always seeking constructive feedback.
  If you have any recommendations or can offer guidance on my journey to becoming a Data Scientist, I'd love to connect!

  Let's collaborate and innovate together!
